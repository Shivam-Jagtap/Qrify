<h1 style="color: #ea433b">What is a QR</h1>
    <h6><p style="color:#537fbe">1 . A QR (Quick Response) code is a two-dimensional barcode that can be scanned using a smartphone camera or a QR code reader. It was originally designed for the automotive industry in Japan but has since become widely used in various industries.</p>
    <p style="color:#537fbe">2 . A QR code can store information such as text, URLs, or contact information, and when scanned, it opens the information stored in the code. QR codes can be used for various purposes such as making payments, accessing websites, or sharing contact information.</p>
    <p style="color:#537fbe">3 . The QR code is made up of black squares arranged on a white background, which allows it to be read quickly by a camera. QR codes are more versatile and efficient than traditional barcodes because they can store more information and be scanned more quickly.</p></h6>
